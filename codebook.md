## Description of Variables

## Summary

Each of the features of this dataset is labelled with a number of indicators, which are summarized in the following list.  A description of each variable follows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Time/Freq - indicates whether the signal is in the Time or Frequency domain.
* Body/Gravity - indicates whether the force measured is due to gravity or body motion.
* Acc/Gyro - indicates whether the measurement is taken from the phone's accelerometer or gyroscope.
* Jerk - indicates whether the observation measures "Jerk" (The first derivative of acceleration).  These are calculated by differentiating the corresponding non-Jerk signal with the otherwise same name.
* Mag - indicates the vector magnitude of a signal, computed by taking the norm of the corresponding observation across X Y and Z.  These observations will not include an axis label.
* Mean/Std - indicates the mean or standard deviation of recorded raw values.
* X/Y/Z - indicates the axis of measurement, in phone-centered co-ordinates.  No axis label indicates a scalar.
